The most straightforward differences are as follows:
 •
 The UPDATE statement uses only two data sets. The number of data sets that the MERGE statement can use is limited only by machine-dependent factors such as memory and disk space.
 
•
 A BY statement must accompany an UPDATE statement. The MERGE statement performs a one-to-one merge if no BY statement follows it.
 
•
 The two statements also process observations differently when a data set contains missing values or multiple observations in a BY group.


**here merge and update produce diff results, merge would have 2 rows for id 3, while update would have 1 row with latest name KK;


data a;
input id name $;
cards;
1 A
2 B
3 C
;
run;



data b;
input id name $;
cards;
1 A
2 BB
3 GG
3 KK
;
run;


data c;
merge a b;
by id;
run;


data d;
update a b;
by id;
run;
