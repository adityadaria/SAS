*In order to slice more observations from the input data set, the POINT= option can be combined with a DO loop: ;



data Out; 
 do Slice=17, 1, 21, 17, 5, 6;  
set sasuser.admit point=Slice; 
output; 
end; 
stop; 
run; 


This code shows that the POINT= option can be used to access any observation, any number of times, in any order 
from the input data set. This ability to randomly access the input data set can be applied in a number of ways to ease 
programming chores. and, since the data is being randomly accessed (i.e. no end-of-file indicator is encountered), you must tell the DATA step when to 
‘OUTPUT’ and when to ‘STOP’.
