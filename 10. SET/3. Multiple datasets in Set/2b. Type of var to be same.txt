* Lets say the datasets have diff structure, one is having age as num and other as char, the SAS throws error and stops;


data amit;
input name $ age;
datalines;
amit 56
cheeku 67
ani 45
nai 78
;
run;


data amit1;
input sirname $ age$;
datalines;
kin 67
nin 78
ben 71
;
run;

data concaten;
set amit amit1;
run;

proc print data=concaten;
run;




49
50   data concaten;
51   set amit amit1;
ERROR: Variable age has been defined as both character and numeric.
52   run;
