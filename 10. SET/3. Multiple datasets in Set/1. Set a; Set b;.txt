* The one to one reading is simply like merge statement, where the second dataset replaces the values of the first one and the merged dataset contains the no. of obs contained in dataset having the smallest no of observations


From the PDV perspective it happens as the EOF marker comes and the observations are not processed beyond that;

dataset a only;
