*using the label option you can assign the temporary label to a variable, it is only for the procprint step
, ie only for the listing output but does not change the data values; however if you use the option in the datastep then the label is permanently assigned;


proc print data=sasuser.admit label split='.';
var age height sex;
label age='total age jkb.vhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh'; 
run;
