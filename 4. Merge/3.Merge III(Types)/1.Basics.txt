1. One to One merging: In one to one merging there is no by statement and the merging is done 
by SAS itself eg leading to the formation of cartesian product.

data one_two;
merge one two;
run;


2. Match merge: The match merge in data step always have the by variable and the datasets are sorted by
that by variable. eg.This is the reason a match merge is also called as a BY Merge.

BY VAR:
1. The by variable can be char or num.
2. The by var should be unique for a record for the merging to be good.
3. The length of the by var should be same in both the datasets to avoid truncation, the length of the var would be defined by the first dataset.

The BY variable has two attributes
1. The By Value
2. The BY group

THE MATCH MERGE ALSO DEPEND ON THE DATASET ORDER IN THE MERGE STATEMENT, THE VALUES OF THE SECOND DATASET ALWAYS REPLACES 
THE VALUES OF THE FIRST ONE.

The MATCH MERGE can be of the following types:

1) zero-to-one
2) one-to-zero
3) one-to-one
4) one-to-many
5) many-to-one
6) few-to-many
7) many-to-few
8) many-to-many
