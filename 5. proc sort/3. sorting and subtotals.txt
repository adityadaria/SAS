* For getting subtotals the dataset need to be sorted by the same by variable;
proc sort data=sasuser.admit out=admit;
by actlevel;
run;

proc print data=admit;
var age sex height;
id name;
sum fee;
by actlevel;
run;
************************************************************
* If you use id actlevel then actlevel heading just comes once as compared to above program;
proc sort data=sasuser.admit out=admit;
by actlevel;
run;

proc print data=admit;
var age sex height;
id actlevel;
sum fee;
by actlevel;

run;
